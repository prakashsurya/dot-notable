# DLPX-66056 SQL Server HammerDB runs on trunk (8/30 build) always is at least 400% slower on the first query set

* https://jira.delphix.com/browse/DLPX-66056

## Next

* Waiting on Jarod:
  * He'll create a new test envionrment to reproduce/iterate

## Problem

* According to Jarod:
  * "TCP-H" is the workoad ([link](http://www.tpc.org/tpch/default.asp))
  * Using iSCSI with ZVOLs
  * A single thread stalls; don't know why
  * It's always "virtual user 7"; don't know if relevant

## Log

### 2019.09.18

I pinged Jarod on slack asking for him to bring me up to speed on this
issue; I'm waiting to hear back from him.

Jarod says he'll create a new target to help with reproducing the issue,
and try to avoid overlap with other code-complete activity.
