## Log

### 2019.10.7

After testing the propsed solution of using "perf record" and "perf
script", I've found that the generated log files are too large to be
consumed by support bundles. Thus, I've decided to drop this work, and
take a different approach via DLPX-64219.

The solution attempted here may still be valid in the future, but more
work will be required; e.g. determining how it'll interact with support
bundles, and the performance playbook infrastructure, etc.
