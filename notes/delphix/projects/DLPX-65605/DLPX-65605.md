# DLPX-65605 Timeout waiting for zvol link to be created

* https://jira.delphix.com/browse/DLPX-65605

## Synopsis

According to John as pointed out in the bug, the issue appears to be a
combination of the following factors:

1. The function used to remove ZVOLs can take a relatively long time to
   remove a single ZVOL.
2. Each ZVOL is removed in a single threaded manner.
3. Each ZVOL is created in a single threaded manner.
4. A relatively large bach of ZVOL removals (prior to a ZVOL create) can
   significantly impact ZVOL creation latency due to the 3 points above.
